                Basic Web
            </h2>

            <p>In the theme of Basic Web I learned basic HTML and CSS to create a mobile website based on the art-style of naivism, as well as a responsive version with media queries. It was my first time ever coding, and creating something in illustrator, which was difficult but a lot of fun once I spent some time doing it.
                <br>
                <br>The final assignment for this theme was a group project where we redesigned a website, which is where I learned a lot about working professionally in a group, and got a better understanding for coding.</p>

                Basic Animation
            </h2>
            <p>Animation was completely new to me, and very fun and interesting to learn more about. I firstly learned about the work you have to do before you even start animating, such as writing a story, designing characters and creating a storyboard.
                <br>
                <br>I was later introduced to JavaScript and all the amazing animations you can do through code. In the final project of the theme my group and I had to create an animated teaser for an old movie called "The Big Sleep", and through this project I got a lot more familiar with illustrator, and got an introduction to After Effects.

            </h2>

            <p>In this theme I finally learned more about the business aspect of multimedia design. The task I got together with my group was to create a fictional digital agency and digital service. We coded a prototype website for the agency and created an interactive prototype for the serivce in Illustrator and After Effects.
                <br><br>Through this task and the business model canvas I learned a lot about different things you need to know before you can start your own business, as well as working professionally in a group to create something. One of the things my group and I struggeled with was the revenue stream, and how our digital agency would make money.</p>

            <p>I went into the theme of video with some basic knowledge of filming and editing, but it was still very educational having to come up with your own ideas and work in a group with others.

                <br><br>For both videos I was filming with my iPhone 7, with a gimbal for optimized image stabilization.</p>

                What did I learn?
            </h2>

            <p>During my first semester at KEA I have touched upon many different aspects of multimedia design, where we mostly learned the basics of each area. However, once I was taught the basics, it was motivating and easy to learn more by myself. Once I got a better understanding of different programming languages and Adobe programmes, it opened up so many possibilites of what I could do.
                <br><br>Most of all, I have gotten a lot more experience of what it is like to work professionally in groups to reach a common goal. This is very important knowledge seeing as a multimedia designer very often has to do this. It was not always easy to direct tasks and take control in a group setting, but it was still very important to get used to it early on.
                <br><br>I have not only learned a lot of new things, but also realized how much fun it can be to learn and understand.
