That includes all the assignments I have completed, both individually and in groups, during my first semester as a Multimedia Design student. <br><br>The projects are devided into four themes that I have covered during my time at KEA and they are displayed in the order I had them from first to last. Hover or click on each assignment to learn more about them and see attached documents.

            </h2>

            <p>In the theme of Basic Web I learned basic HTML and CSS to create a mobile website based on the art-style of naivism, as well as a responsive version with media queries. It was my first time ever coding, and creating something in illustrator, which was difficult but a lot of fun once I spent some time doing it.
                <br>
                <br>The final assignment for this theme was a group project where we redesigned a website, which is where I learned a lot about working professionally in a group, and got a better understanding for coding.</p>

            <p>Animation was completely new to me, and very fun and interesting to learn more about. I firstly learned about the work you have to do before you even start animating, such as writing a story, designing characters and creating a storyboard.
                <br>
                <br>I was later introduced to JavaScript and all the amazing animations you can do through code. In the final project of the theme my group and I had to create an animated teaser for an old movie called "The Big Sleep", and through this project I got a lot more familiar with illustrator, and got an introduction to After Effects.

            <p>In this theme I finally learned more about the business aspect of multimedia design. The task I got together with my group was to create a fictional digital agency and digital service. We coded a prototype website for the agency and created an interactive prototype for the serivce in Illustrator and After Effects.
                <br><br>Through this task and the business model canvas I learned a lot about different things you need to know before you can start your own business, as well as working professionally in a group to create something. One of the things my group and I struggeled with was the revenue stream, and how our digital agency would make money.</p>

                What did I learn?<br><br><br>
            </h2>

            <p>During my first semester at KEA I have touched upon many different aspects of multimedia design, where we mostly learned the basics of each area. However, once I was taught the basics, it was motivating and easy to learn more by myself. Once I got a better understanding of different programming languages and Adobe programmes, it opened up so many possibilites of what I could do.
                <br><br>Most of all, I have gotten a lot more experience of what it is like to work professionally in groups to reach a common goal. This is very important knowledge seeing as a multimedia designer very often has to do this. It was not always easy to direct tasks and take control in a group setting, but it was still very important to get used to it early on.
                <br><br>I have not only learned a lot of new things, but also realized how much fun it can be to learn and understand.
